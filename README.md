## ⭐ Prerequisites

*   **Google Chrome** (or a Chromium-based browser like Brave or Edge).
*   Download **`SplashyCM_extension.zip`** file. [**Click to download SplashyCM_extension.zip**](https://github.com/boadley/SplashyCM/releases/download/v1.0.0/SplashyCM_extension.zip).

## Step 1: Download & Unzip the Extension

1.  Locate the `SplashyCM_extension.zip` file on your computer.
2.  **Unzip/Extract** the file. This will create a new folder. Remember where you saved this folder, as you will need it shortly.

> **Important:** You are not installing the `.zip` file itself, but rather loading the entire **unzipped folder** into Chrome.

## Step 2: Install the Extension in Chrome

1.  Open Google Chrome, type **`chrome://extensions`** into your address bar, and press **Enter**.
2.  In the top-right corner, enable **"Developer mode"**.

4.  A file dialog will open. Navigate to and select the **unzipped folder** from Step 1.
5.  The "X Pro - AI Auto Like & Reply Bot" will now appear in your list of extensions. We recommend **pinning it** to your toolbar for easy access.

## Step 4: Configure the Bot's Settings

The bot is now active but **Paused** by default. Before you begin, let's review the settings available on the dashboard.

#### 1. Master Control & Status

*   **Active/Paused Toggle:** This is the main switch for the bot. To start its operations, toggle it to **"Active"** and **reload the X Pro tab**. To stop it completely, set it to **"Paused"** and reload the tab.
*   **Status Panel:**
    *   **Plan:** Your current subscription plan.
    *   **Replies Left:** The total number of AI replies remaining in your plan's quota.
    *   **Today:** The number of replies made in the current 24-hour cycle vs. your daily randomized limit.

#### 2. Behavior Settings

*   **Reply Probability:** The chance the bot will *attempt* to reply to a new tweet it sees. An 80% setting means it will skip 20% of tweets to appear more human.
*   **Like-Only Probability:** After liking a tweet, this is the chance it will **stop** and *not* send a reply. This is great for varying your engagement so you're not replying to everything you like.
*   **Daily Replies (Min-Max):** Each day, the bot will pick a random number of replies to make between your set minimum and maximum. This avoids posting the same number of times daily.

#### 3. Targeting Settings

*   **Monitor All Columns:** Check this box if you want the bot to watch every single column in your X Pro deck.
*   **Monitor Specific Columns:** If "Monitor All Columns" is unchecked, you can specify exactly which columns to watch here. **Numbering starts at 0.**
    *   `0` = The first column from the left.
    *   `1` = The second column.
    *   `0,2` = The first and third columns.

#### 4. Custom Persona

*   This is a powerful feature to customize the AI's personality. Add simple, direct instructions to shape its voice.
*   **Example:** "Your name is Leo. You are a Bitcoin maximalist. You are very skeptical of altcoins. Never use emojis."

## Step 5: Start Engaging!

1.  Configure your settings in the popup as described above.
2.  Click **"Save Settings"**.
3.  Make sure the master toggle is set to **"Active"**.
4.  **RELOAD the `pro.x.com` tab.** This is a crucial final step to apply all your new settings and start the bot.

The bot will now begin monitoring your specified columns for new tweets!
